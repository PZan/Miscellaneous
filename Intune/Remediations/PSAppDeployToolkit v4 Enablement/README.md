# Install PSAppDeployToolkit Module
Starting with version 4 the PSAppDeployToolkit is module based and available in PSGallery!
This opens up for extended usage, for example remediation scripts. [Here's an example where a reboot countdown is presented when a pending reboot is detected.](../Invoke%20Interactive%20Reboot)

## About this remediation
The idea with this remediation is to have the PSAppDeployToolkit module available on all devices, so that we can utilize the module in remediation scripts.
